# MyReads Project

It is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorise books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves", each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.
The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books.

# Running the app

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
